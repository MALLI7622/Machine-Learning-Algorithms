# Text Mercato Assignment

The given problem was an unsupervised learning problem. By doing this problem I had used KMeans algorithm, But the images contain different sizes. So I had 
cropped the images into equal sizes. Before training I had flatten the data into single dimension. I had applied multiple k values to the model. I had approached adding extra white spaces to small width images, But the results wouldn't change.
